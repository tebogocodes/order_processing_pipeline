# order_processing_pipeline

Order Processing Pipeline Prototype
This project serves as a prototype for an Order Processing pipeline, showcasing proficiency in Python, Django, Docker, MySQL, AWS, API integration, REDIS, and asynchronous programming. The solution fulfills the following requirements:

Requirements
Accept Orders
Task users depending on the type of order or variable associated with the item ordered
Call an external API and make a decision based on the result
Deliverables
1. Dockerized Django Application:
A Django application is created.
Dockerized the application for easy deployment.
2. MySQL Database Integration:
Integrated a MySQL database with the Django application.
Implemented basic CRUD operations.
3. AWS Deployment:
The Dockerized application is deployed on AWS.
Documented the deployment process.
4. API Integration:
Integrated a third-party API into the application.
Demonstrated data retrieval and processing.
5. REDIS Implementation:
Utilized REDIS for caching frequently accessed data.
Showcased performance improvement through caching.
6. Asynchronous API:
Implemented an asynchronous endpoint in the Django application.
Demonstrated non-blocking API calls or long-running task processing.
7. Testing:
Wrote unit tests for critical components of the application.
Documented the testing approach and results.
8. Scalability and Optimization:
Discussed how the application can be scaled.
Identified potential optimizations for performance improvement.
Setup and Installation
To run the project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository: git clone <repository-url>
Navigate to the project directory: cd <project-directory>
Set up the environment and dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Configure the Django settings for the MySQL database and AWS deployment.
